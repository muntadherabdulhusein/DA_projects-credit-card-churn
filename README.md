 ## 🏢 Description

This project focuses on predicting customer churn and providing actionable insights into customer behavior and retention strategies for a credit card company. Our team was tasked with analyzing a dataset containing customer demographic, account, and transaction information to uncover patterns and trends related to churn. This analysis explores customer segmentation, churn drivers, and potential strategies for customer retention.

Python: For data manipulation, analysis,machine learning, and visualization.
